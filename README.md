#  Iris Flower Classification

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using Machine Learning. The model predicts whether a flower belongs to Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements.

This project was completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

---

##  Objective
To build a supervised machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into three species using Logistic Regression.

---

##  Dataset Information
The dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target Variable)
